what is closures?

In JavaScript, a closure is a function that can access variables from its outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are created when a function is defined inside another function. 
Lexical scope ?

Lexical scope in JavaScript is a programming concept that determines the scope of a variable based on where it's declared in the code. It's also known as static scoping. 

Event Loop and Asynchronous JavaScript
JavaScript uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations. The call stack, callback queue, and microtask queue work together to execute synchronous and asynchronous code.

Execution Process:
Synchronous code executes first (Call Stack).
Promises and async/await go into the Microtask Queue (higher priority than Callback Queue).
Callbacks from events, timers, or async operations go into the Callback Queue.
